Learn Chinese with flash cards
------------------------------

These flash cards are collections from chatting with my Taiwanese
friends and colleagues. Hope to complete them more as time goes by.
Feel free to add to them, and then you can let me know, I'd love
to include that here too.

To use these cards, install Granule from:
http://granule.sourceforge.net/

It is available for both Linux & Windows.

Have fun learning!
